# Frontend development server
### Installation
To play around with the React frontend NodeJS (v12) is required.

Navigate to the project folder, then into the frontend folder. Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd frontend
$ npm install -d
$ node start
```

This will start the development server for the frontend. Open a browser window and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
